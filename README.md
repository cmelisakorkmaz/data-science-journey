## Background:
A quality control specialist with experience in the medical device industry and a strong interest in data science and software development. 

I started my career in a highly regulated environment, where I developed an eye for detail, process optimization, and compliance. Over time, I became increasingly interested in how data can be used to solve problems, make decisions, and improve systems.

To build my skills, Iâ€™ve completed courses in Python, C#, and working on data analysis, and Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects that combine my background with technology.

I'm passionate about learning, solving real-world problems, and building tools that make life easier and smarter.

ðŸ“Œ Currently exploring: data analysis, automation, and cross-platform development (Flutter & Python)
